<h1>Sonnet 3</h1>

Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest <br>
Now is the time that face should form another;<br>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br>
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br>
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br><br>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb<br>
Of his self-love, to stop posterity? <br>
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<br>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;<br>
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.<br>
But if thou live, remembered not to be,<br>
Die single and thine image dies with thee.<br>
