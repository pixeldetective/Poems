<h1> Sonnet 2 </h1>

When forty winters shall besiege thy brow, <br>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br>
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
Will be a totter'd weed of small worth held: <br>
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; <br>
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,<br>
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br>
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'<br>
Proving his beauty by succession thine!<br>
This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.<br>
