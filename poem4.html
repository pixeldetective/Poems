<h1> Sonnet 5 </h1>

Those hours, that with gentle work did frame <br>
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, <br>
Will play the tyrants to the very same <br>
And that unfair which fairly doth excel; <br>
For never-resting time leads summer on <br>
To hideous winter, and confounds him there; <br>
Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone, <br>
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where: <br>
Then were not summer's distillation left, <br>
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, <br>
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, <br>
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was: <br>
But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet, <br>
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet. <br>
