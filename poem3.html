<h1> Sonnet 4 </h1>

Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend <br>
Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy? <br>
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend, <br>
And being frank she lends to those are free: <br>
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse <br>
The bounteous largess given thee to give? <br>
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use <br>
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live? <br>
For having traffic with thy self alone, <br>
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive: <br>
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone, <br>
What acceptable audit canst thou leave? <br>
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee, <br>
Which, used, lives th' executor to be. <br>
